# Notice of Non-Maintenance

This project, named Dyabl, was developed several years ago for educational purposes and to facilitate learning programming. Please note that this code is no longer actively maintained.

## Linguistic Note

It is important to note that this code may contain comments, variable names, or other elements in French, unlike the usual convention which uses English.

## Project Objective

This project encompasses a series of algorithms created for educational purposes. It covers various areas of programming and was designed to serve as a learning tool and reference for beginners.

## Content

The code is organized based on different algorithmic concepts and problems. You will find a variety of examples, ranging from simple data structures to more complex algorithms.

## Usage

This repository is provided in the hope that it may be useful to those who are learning or teaching programming. Feel free to explore, experiment, and use the code as needed. However, please be aware that due to the lack of maintenance, issues or bugs may arise during its use.

**About the name "Dyabl":**

Dyabl sounds like "diable," which is the mascot of BSDs.
It was a play on words in Franglais (French-English) that could mean:

- **License Version:** Damn Yet Another BSD Library
- **Ego Version:** Damn Yet Another Bartoletti Lo√Øc ...
- **Real Version:** Damn Yet Another Bullshit Library
- **Humorous Version:** Do You Actually Believe Learning?
